# Introduction

The Titanium Docs DevKit for VuePress is composed of a [theme](../theme/README.md) and two [plugins](../plugins/README.md). It was mainly created to modernize the documentation needs of [Titanium](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile) and make it easier for the community to contribute to our open source projects.

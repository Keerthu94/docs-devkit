# Getting started

::: warning VUEPRESS COMPATIBILITY NOTE
The theme and plugins of the Titanium docs devkit are build for VuePress >= 1.x.
:::

## Installation

Please refer to the specific [theme](../theme/README.md) or [plugins](../plugins/README.md) install intructions. All packages are independent of each other so they can be used on their own.

::: tip
If you quickly want to try out the plugins we recommend to use the Titanium theme too. It has built-in support for the plugins and offers the same features and config options as the default VuePress theme (it is actually based on [@vuepress/theme-default](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress/tree/master/packages/%40vuepress/theme-default)).

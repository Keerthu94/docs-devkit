# Plugins

The Titanium Docs DevKit currently provides two plugins for VuePress.

The [API Reference Plugin](./apidocs-plugin.md) can be used easily add API docs to a markdown file. These usually are too complex to write directly in markdown, which is where this plugin steps in.

With the [Versioning Plugin](./versioning-plugin.md) you can add versioning features to VuePress. Snapshot the current state of your docs to easily access older revisions at a later time. The [Titanium Theme](../theme/README.md) has full support for the versioning plugin and allows you to switch between the different versions of your site.
